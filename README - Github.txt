IMPORTANT - This project has been uploaded to demonstrate coding ability for academic and professional purposes, not for public use. 
All the results are outlined in the project PDF, however if you wish to run the code personally, please email me (mjr85344@gmail.com) to request access 
to the datafiles needed to perform the code. 

IMPORTANT - All code was run on Google Colab, which is what the instructions will tell you how to set up. The code is not set up to run on other enviroments.

Code set-up instructions:
1) Upload the 8 Excel files (Provided on request) onto the google drive you are using to run the code. (Do not save to any specific folder)
2) The code will request permission to connect to your google drive. Give access, without it the colab notebook will not be able to access the uploaded 
   excel files.

Once these 2 steps have been performed, the code should run smoothly. 

Run Time
- Statistical notebook will complete in around 2 minutes. 
- Model Notebook will complete in around 35 minutes.
